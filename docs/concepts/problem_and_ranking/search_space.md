# SearchSpace

`SearchSpace` defines candidate representation and the services that operate on that representation.
Algorithms and surrogates use the `GenomeBatch` and services provided by the space instead of changing its internal representation directly.

## SearchSpace's role

`SearchSpace` provides `representation`, `services`, `sample()`, and `validate()`.
`GenomeBatch` stores candidates row-wise; it does not directly own candidate IDs or objective values.
`validate()` returns per-row validity and batch-wide errors in a `ValidationResult`.

`ServiceRegistry` registers the services provided by a space by name.
The space that needs them exposes sampling, validation, cloning, equivalence, distance, genome serialization, and other capabilities as SearchSpace services.
`EvaluationAdapter` is the Adapter boundary that converts a `GenomeBatch` into an evaluation Payload.
`FeatureEncoder` is an Adapter subtype responsible for the semantic conversion `GenomeBatch → FeatureEncoder → FeatureBatch → Surrogate`. Unlike a space capability such as `SamplingService`, it determines the features the surrogate can learn.
The public import is `from saealib.space import FeatureEncoder`.

## What SearchSpace holds

Built-in spaces are divided by the constraints on their representations:

- **`VectorSpace`**: Handles fixed-width dense numeric vectors.
- **`ObjectSpace`**: The minimal space for holding arbitrary object representations.
- **`SequenceSpace`**: Handles sequences whose length can vary.
- **`PermutationSpace`**: Handles representations that satisfy permutation constraints.

Each space satisfies the common `SearchSpace` contract, but its service set and `RepresentationSpec` differ.
For example, `ObjectSpace` does not register default services, so the configuration must provide the services required by the algorithm separately.

## Invariants

`RepresentationSpec` describes parameter types, shapes, and representation kinds.
This description says how candidates are stored; it is not itself an implementation of sampling or feature encoding.

Services are the executable boundaries that fill this gap.
In the current implementation, the SurrogateManager contract declares `ServiceRequirement("FeatureEncoder")`, and `VectorSpace` registers a default encoder as a service, so numeric vector spaces resolve without extra configuration. `ObjectSpace`, `PermutationSpace`, and `SequenceSpace` raise an error unless the user provides a `FeatureEncoder`. The user decides what to pass to the surrogate.

## Extending SearchSpace

`SearchSpace` owns candidate representation, candidate-generation services, and representation validity.
It does not own candidate objective values, observation provenance, component state, or Graph execution order.
The space owns the representation rules and services for `GenomeBatch` values, while `Population` owns the live genome storage.
`Population.genomes` exposes that storage as a read-only view, not an immutable snapshot; subsequent Population updates may change its contents.
It does not implicitly add candidate IDs or Feedback results.

When adding a new candidate representation, define its `RepresentationSpec`, sampling, validation, and required services within one `SearchSpace` boundary.
Do not move `RepresentationSpec` into `ComponentContract`; declare connections to the port's `DataSpec` and required services in the Compiler.

## Common failures

The `RepresentationSpec` and service set are fixed when the space is constructed, and the Compiler checks them against the component's `ServiceRequirement`.
The `GenomeBatch` returned by `sample()` conforms to the space's `RepresentationSpec`, and `validate()` reports mismatches in a `ValidationResult` instead of silently repairing them.
`SearchSpace` owns service implementation state, while components request and use registered services.
Mismatched kinds or shapes, missing required services, and invalid `GenomeBatch` values become Diagnostics from the Compiler or `ValidationResult`.
