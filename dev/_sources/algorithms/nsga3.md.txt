# NSGA-III

NSGA-III is a genetic algorithm that extends NSGA-II's selection mechanism to many-objective optimization with four or more objectives.
It replaces crowding-distance diversity maintenance with a niche-preservation operation against pre-placed reference points, maintaining the distribution of the solution set even as the number of objectives grows.

## Overview

Once the number of objectives grows to four or more, NSGA-II's crowding distance can no longer adequately maintain diversity.
Because the fraction of non-dominated individuals in a randomly generated population grows exponentially with the number of objectives, narrowing down by dominance relations alone is no longer enough to fill the next-generation population, and the relative weight of the role crowding distance plays in diversity maintenance grows accordingly.

NSGA-III replaces this crowding distance with a niche-preservation operation against **reference points** pre-placed in objective space.
In each generation, the hyperplane intercepts are computed from the population's **ideal point** and **extreme points** to normalize the objectives, and each individual is associated with the reference point to which it has the smallest perpendicular distance.
For the last front that cannot be fully accepted, reference points with fewer already-assigned individuals (niche count) are prioritized, and individuals associated with each are chosen in order of smallest perpendicular distance, leaving a roughly equal number of solutions per reference point.

Because NSGA-III already secures diversity through this niche-preservation operation, it does not use dominance-based parent selection like NSGA-II.
Parents are chosen randomly from the current population, and crossover and mutation are applied to generate the offspring population.

Uniform placement of reference points uses the simplex-lattice design proposed by Das and Dennis (Das & Dennis, 1998).

The source is {cite}`deb2014nsga3`. The concrete procedure is shown in the pseudocode below.

## Pseudocode

```{prf:algorithm} NSGA-III
:label: alg-nsga3

**Inputs** objective functions, reference point set $Z^r$ (structured points $Z^s$ or user-specified points $Z^a$), population size $N$, initial population $P_0$
**Output** the population $P_{t+1}$ of the final generation

1. Set $t=0$; generate an offspring population $Q_0$ via crossover and mutation from a randomly generated $P_0$
2. Form the combined population $R_t = P_t \cup Q_t$ (size $2N$)
3. Non-dominated-sort $R_t$ to obtain the front sequence $\mathcal{F} = (\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2, \ldots)$
4. Set $S_t = \emptyset$, adding fronts to $S_t$ in order starting from $\mathcal{F}_1$ until $|S_t| \geq N$. Let $\mathcal{F}_l$ be the last front added, $P_{t+1} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{l-1}\mathcal{F}_i$, and $K = N - |P_{t+1}|$ (if $|S_t|=N$, set $P_{t+1}=S_t$ directly and proceed to step 8)
5. Compute the hyperplane intercepts from $S_t$'s ideal point and extreme points to normalize the objectives, and place $Z^r$ in the normalized objective space
6. Associate each individual in $S_t$ with the point having the smallest perpendicular distance to a reference line through the origin and each point of $Z^r$
7. Compute each reference point's niche count $\rho_j$ from the associations on $\mathcal{F}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_{l-1}$, then select $K$ individuals from $\mathcal{F}_l$, prioritizing reference points with the smallest niche count, and add them to $P_{t+1}$
8. Choose parents randomly from $P_{t+1}$, apply crossover and mutation to generate $Q_{t+1}$. Set $t=t+1$ and return to step 2, repeating until the termination condition is reached

## Complexity

Non-dominated sorting is $O(N\log^{M-2}N)$ ($M$ the number of objectives, $N$ the population size), which is an asymptotically different complexity from NSGA-II's $O(MN^2)$.
The worst-case per-generation complexity combining normalization, association, and niche preservation is the larger of $O(N^2\log^{M-2}N)$ and $O(N^2 M)$ {cite}`deb2014nsga3`.

## Configuration in saealib

| Role | saealib implementation | Corresponding step |
|---|---|---|
| Search algorithm | `GA` (`ask()` performs crossover and mutation; `tell()` performs combining $R_t=P_t\cup Q_t$ and survivor selection) | L1-2, 8 |
| Parent selection | `TournamentSelection(tournament_size=1)` (with tournament size 1, no comparison is actually performed, corresponding to the paper's Section IV-F description of "choose parents randomly from $P_{t+1}$") | L1, 8 |
| Crossover | `CrossoverSBX(prob=1.0, eta=30.0)` | L1, 8 |
| Mutation | `MutationPolynomial(eta=20.0)` | L1, 8 |
| Reference point generation | `uniform_weight_vectors(n_obj, n_divisions)` (generates the initial value $Z^s$ of $Z^r$ via the Das-Dennis simplex lattice) | L5 |
| Non-dominated sorting + normalization + association + niche preservation | `NSGA3Comparator` (`sort_population` internally calls `_normalize_objectives`/`_associate_to_reference_points`/`_niche_count_select` in order) | L3-7 |
| Survivor selection | `TruncationSelection()` (keeps the top $N$ individuals in the order given by `comparator.sort_population`) | L4-7 |
| Evaluation strategy | `DirectStrategy` (no surrogate involved; every candidate generated by `GA.ask()` is evaluated with the true objective function) | L2 |

```python
from saealib import GA, NSGA3Comparator, Optimizer, uniform_weight_vectors
from saealib.benchmarks import dtlz2
from saealib.operators.crossover import CrossoverSBX
from saealib.operators.mutation import MutationPolynomial
from saealib.operators.selection import TournamentSelection, TruncationSelection
from saealib.strategies import DirectStrategy
from saealib.termination import Termination, max_fe


problem = dtlz2(n_obj=3)
reference_points = uniform_weight_vectors(n_obj=3, n_divisions=8)
problem.comparator = NSGA3Comparator(reference_points)

algorithm = GA(
    CrossoverSBX(prob=1.0, eta=30.0),
    MutationPolynomial(eta=20.0),
    TournamentSelection(tournament_size=1),
    TruncationSelection(),
)

opt = (
    Optimizer(problem)
    .set_algorithm(algorithm)
    .set_strategy(DirectStrategy())
    .set_termination(Termination(max_fe(3000)))
)
ctx = opt.run()
pareto_f = ctx.pareto_archive.get_array("f")
```

The `problem.comparator = NSGA3Comparator(reference_points)` line cannot be omitted.
In NSGA-II, `NSGA2Comparator` is the default for `n_obj > 1`, so the same line could be omitted, but in NSGA-III, as with SPEA2, an explicit assignment is required.

DTLZ2 with 3 objectives is used instead of a 2-objective ZDT benchmark because NSGA-III is aimed at many-objective optimization with four or more objectives, and the effect of reference-point-based niche preservation only shows up starting with three or more objectives.

## Parameters and variants

**$\eta_c$ (SBX distribution index) and crossover probability $p_c$**: The paper's Table II reports using $p_c=1$ (`CrossoverSBX(prob=1.0)`) and $\eta_c=30$ (`CrossoverSBX(eta=30.0)`) for NSGA-III.
Both the crossover probability and distribution index are larger than NSGA-II's defaults ($p_c=0.9$, $\eta_c=20$), a setting that generates offspring closer to the parents with higher probability {cite}`deb2014nsga3`.

**Correspondence between population size $N$ and reference-point count $H$**: The paper recommends choosing the population size $N$ as the smallest multiple of 4 at or above the reference-point count $H$.
Unless `set_initializer()` is called, `Optimizer` uses `LHSInitializer(n_init_population=4*dim)` as the default, so this population size depends only on the decision-variable dimension `dim`, and is not tied to `H`.
If you want the population size deliberately matched to `H`, check the number of rows returned by `uniform_weight_vectors` and explicitly specify `n_init_population` via `set_initializer()`.

**Why parent selection isn't tournament-based**: Section IV-F of the paper states that, since NSGA-III already secures diversity through its niche-preservation operation, it chooses parents randomly rather than using an explicit selection operator {cite}`deb2014nsga3`.
`TournamentSelection(tournament_size=1)` expresses this "random parent selection," since no comparison is actually performed when the tournament size is 1.
Changing `tournament_size` to 2 or more adds the same dominance-based selection pressure as NSGA-II/SPEA2, introducing a selection mechanism the paper deliberately excludes.

**Swapping the dominator (dominance predicate)**: `NSGA3Comparator(reference_points, dominator=...)` lets you inject a [Dominator](../components/dominance.md) other than the default `ParetoDominator`.
Since this changes the result of non-dominated sorting itself, the population subjected to front splitting and niche preservation also depends on this dominance predicate.
