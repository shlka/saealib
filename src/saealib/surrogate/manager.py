"""Surrogate managers for fitting models and producing predictions.

Responsibility split:
  Surrogate           -- fits a model and predicts SurrogatePrediction
  AcquisitionFunction -- converts SurrogatePrediction to scalar scores
  SurrogateManager    -- coordinates training and prediction; exposes predict()

Classes
-------
GlobalSurrogateManager
    Fits once on the full archive; batch predict.
LocalSurrogateManager
    Fits a local KNN model per candidate.
CompositeSurrogateManager
    Composes named predictions from multiple sub-managers.
PairwiseSurrogateManager
    Fits a pairwise classifier and predicts per-candidate win rates.

Combine functions
-----------------
product_combine
    Element-wise product of score arrays (e.g. EI x PoF).
rank_weighted_combine
    Returns a combine function that rank-normalises then takes a weighted average.

    channel. Pair with :class:`~saealib.acquisition.winrate.WinRateAcquisition`

    reference-sampling logic runs, and ``AcquisitionFunction`` deliberately
    has no ``Surrogate``/``SurrogateManager`` access to construct and predict
    on them itself.

    The surrogate must be a :class:`~saealib.surrogate.base.ComparisonSurrogate`
    that implements ``predict_proba()``.

    ----------
    surrogate : ComparisonSurrogate
        Pairwise comparison surrogate (e.g. ``SklearnRFCClassificationSurrogate``).
    training_set : TrainingSet or None
        Training data builder.  Defaults to ``PairwiseComparisonSet()``.
        ``ctx`` is required when using ``PairwiseComparisonSet``.
    n_ref : int
        Number of archive points sampled, once per :meth:`predict` call, as
        the shared reference set every candidate in that call is compared
        against. When the archive has fewer than ``n_ref`` points all are
        used.
